Every dam that is producing power and is fully operational uses the hydroelectric concept. The water from the rivers is collected on the downstream side of the dam. To generate power, the water is allowed to proceed once it reaches a certain level. The water turbine then rotates, converting the kinetic energy of the falling water into mechanical energy at the turbine shaft. Simply stated, falling water drives the water turbine. Through the use of an associated alternator, the turbine converts mechanical energy into electrical energy. The following describes the "basic operating concept of a hydroelectric power plant." The water runs through the downstream section of the river. Water level monitoring at dams is a basic measurement. The main requirements for such a measurement are reliability and very high accuracy. Water Level Sensors are deployed in the upstream region, 15-20 km away, to monitor the water level and safety of the upstream. The necessary data is regularly updated by these sensors. The water level (m) and discharge (m3/sec) are directly proportional, meaning that as the water level upstream rises, so will the discharge.

The goal is to build a machine learning model that can learn from the provided dataset on its own. The model need to be able to forecast and track the trend of water discharge and dam level over the course of many seasons. The problem deals with reinforcement learning area of machine learning.
